# Sequences to Record for Visualization
#
# Priority sequences based on Lyapunov analysis
# Record these in Hyperspeedcube and convert to GIF

## High Priority (Most Chaotic - High λ)

[ ] FR → UF
    Period: 10,080
    Classification: Chaotic
    Notes: High Lyapunov exponent, very sensitive to perturbations
    Output: figures/sequence_FR_UF.gif

[ ] FR → UF → OR
    Period: 2,160
    Classification: Chaotic/Sensitive
    Notes: Medium complexity, good for comparison
    Output: figures/sequence_FR_UF_OR.gif

[ ] FR → UF → OR → RO
    Period: 41,496 (RECORD!)
    Classification: Highly chaotic
    Notes: Longest period found, extremely chaotic
    Output: figures/sequence_FR_UF_OR_RO.gif

## Comparison (Regular Behavior - Low λ)

[ ] OF → OU
    Period: 6
    Classification: Regular
    Notes: Very simple, predictable behavior
    Output: figures/sequence_OF_OU.gif

[ ] FR (single move)
    Period: 4
    Classification: Regular
    Notes: Baseline - simplest possible sequence
    Output: figures/sequence_FR.gif

## Optional (Interesting Patterns)

[ ] OR → OU
    Period: 12
    Notes: Simple but interesting 4D rotation pattern
    Output: figures/sequence_OR_OU.gif

[ ] UF → OU
    Period: varies
    Notes: Another baseline sequence
    Output: figures/sequence_UF_OU.gif

## Recording Checklist

Before recording each sequence:
1. [ ] Hyperspeedcube puzzle reset to solved (Ctrl+R)
2. [ ] Camera angle set to good 4D view
3. [ ] Animation speed slowed (0.25x or 0.5x recommended)
4. [ ] High contrast stickers enabled
5. [ ] Screen recorder ready (SimpleScreenRecorder/OBS)

After recording:
1. [ ] Video saved with descriptive name
2. [ ] Convert to GIF: ./scripts/video_to_gif.sh input.mp4 output.gif
3. [ ] Check GIF size (< 5MB preferred)
4. [ ] Move to figures/ directory
5. [ ] Update progress in this file

## Conversion Commands

```bash
# Standard conversion
./scripts/video_to_gif.sh recording_FR_UF.mp4 figures/sequence_FR_UF.gif

# Higher quality (larger file)
./scripts/video_to_gif.sh recording.mp4 output.gif 640 20

# Smaller file (lower quality)
./scripts/video_to_gif.sh recording.mp4 output.gif 320 10
```

## Notes

- Record 2-3 full periods for periodic sequences
- For chaotic sequences (long periods), show ~5-10 moves
- Keep GIFs under 5MB for easy report inclusion
- Use descriptive filenames matching sequence notation

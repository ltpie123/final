## Educational Use

This project was developed as part of Math 538 (Discrete Dynamical Systems &
Chaos Theory) coursework. It is intended for educational purposes and
demonstrates concepts in:

- Discrete dynamical systems
- Orbit analysis and periodicity
- Finite state space dynamics
- High-dimensional group theory
- Computational mathematics

## Attribution

This project uses the Hyperspeedcube library:
- Repository: https://github.com/HactarCE/Hyperspeedcube
- Author: HactarCE
- License: MPL-2.0

The Hyperspeedcube library is used as a dependency for puzzle mechanics and
state management. This project (CTRL) implements trajectory analysis algorithms
on top of that library.

## Academic Integrity

If using this code for academic purposes, please:
1. Cite this work appropriately
2. Follow your institution's academic integrity policies
3. Use as reference/inspiration, not direct submission
4. Understand the mathematical concepts, not just the implementation

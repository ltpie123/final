# 4D-Hypercube Obital Exploration

## Description

This is a multi-application project that explores the 4D hypercube. It is at its core a rust built application from source at [https://github.com/HactarCE/4D-Hypercube-Obital-Exploration](https://github.com/HactarCE/Hyperspeedcube). I will be hijacking control of the application via rust using an assortment of libraries. The displays will be written in octave .m files and will be rendered for later use.
